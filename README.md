## Welcome!

To get started:

- Clone the repo locally	
- Open the solution in Visual Studio	
- Run "Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r" from the Package Manager Console	
- Finally run the project for further instructions

##What I did
1. I made the ArtistDetails page data driven, so it loads all the artist info based on the Id.
2. I Created the api with all the needed endpoints.
3. After I finished with all the tasks I decided to create another view to show all the songs based on inserted Id, as also all of the albums.
4. I uploaded the database on azure and I hosted the project, you can visit: https://multitracks-webforms.azurewebsites.net
5. There is an input at the bottom so you can insert Id. (Id suggestions to test: 1, 5, 172)
